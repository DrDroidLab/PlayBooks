## Create Playbooks & automate investigations:
- Fetch observability data from Datadog, Cloudwatch, New Relic, Grafana, PostgreSQL and more. Full list [here](https://docs.drdroid.io/docs/integrations).
- Triggers: Auto-trigger a playbook from an alert in Slack.
- Auto-investigation: Receive response after a playbook run in your Slack channel or your alerting tool with the investigation data published.


### What can you automate with Playbooks?
- Continous monitoring of critical user workflows and metrics every [5] minutes for [12] hours after a new deployment.
- Automatically enrich a Slack alert with a preliminary investigation summary that can help a reader investigate faster.
- Create & share playbooks with debugging strategy for parts of the system that you understand well.
- See the investigation data from the previous time a similar alert was seen in your system.
- Have a preliminary investigation ready for you in Slack even before you open an alert.
